# simple_fs

The driver code and the code for disk simulation was taken from: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/

The objective of this project was to create a lightweight and efficient 
  > Given the simplicity of SimpleFS, it can serve as a good starting point for learning about filesystems and their internal mechanisms.
  > I could implement various file operations, including file creation, file deletion, file opening, file closing, reading from files, writing to files, and file seeking in a way that handles error cases and ensure that the filesystem remains consistent throughout the operations.

Really thankful to https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/ for providing an amazing resource to learn about Operating Systems.
